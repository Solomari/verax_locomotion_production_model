[features]
# poc_markers = markers from 'point of care' devices, ie readings from the istat, vetscan, or icheck devices. 
# set to "all" if you want to include the full standard set of markers. set to "none" if you don't want to include any
poc_markers : vAST,vCK, vUA, vGLU, vCA, vPHOS, vTP, vALB, vGLOB, vK, vNA, iNa, iK, iCl, iTCO2, 
    iGlu, iAnGap, iHct, iHb, Carotenoids_whole_blood
# which set of blood readings to use: 'istat', 'vetscan', 'icheck', 'all', or a combination. If poc_markers is "none",
# or "all" then this parameter will be ignored but it still has to be set.
device : all
# any non-poc features to also include. set to "none" if you don't want to include any. Set to "all" if you want
# to include every feature. If you use "all" here it will override the poc_markers keyword / list and just use everything
additional_features : Age

[labels]
# a model will be trained to predict each of the given labels
labels : FH, TDS
## Combine related labels (vet scores) into groups and train the models on these new aggregate labels?
# Set to "no" to just treat each vet score separately.
# If you want to make groups use the format : 
# group_name - vetscore,vetscore,vetscore - threshold; group_name - vetscore,vetscore,vetscore - threshold
# threshold is a number that represents the number of scores in the group that must be positive to count
# the group as positive
group_labels :  no
